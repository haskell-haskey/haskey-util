Haskey is a transactional, ACID compliant, embeddable, scalable key-value
store written entirely in Haskell. It was developed as part of the [Summer of Haskell 2017][soh2017] project.

An introductory blog post on Haskey can be found [here][introduction].

_Disclaimer: Haskey is not production ready yet. We are still actively making
changes to the public API and the internals, as well as the binary format._
